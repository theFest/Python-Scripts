""" The code defines several classes for advanced deployment tasks. The NetworkCheck class provides an implementation for checking the network connection. The DeployJobs class provides an implementation for deploying jobs.
The AdvancedDeployJobs class inherits from both NetworkCheck and DeployJobs and provides additional advanced deployment tasks along with the deployment of jobs. The advanced_deploy method of the AdvancedDeployJobs class takes in 5 parameters, including a CSV file. The method performs network checking and additional advanced deployment tasks and then calls the deploy method of the DeployJobs class.
The AdvancedDeployJobs class also provides methods for executing a command on a remote host using SSH and for deploying to multiple remote hosts from a CSV file. The deploy_to_host method connects to a remote host, authenticates using the provided username and password, and executes a list of commands.
The deploy_to_hosts_from_file method reads a CSV file and calls the deploy_to_host method for each row in the file.
Finally, the AdvancedDeployment function creates an instance of the AdvancedDeployJobs class and calls its advanced_deploy method with the specified parameters, including the CSV file, followed by calling the deploy_to_hosts_from_file method. The script also contains a main block for executing the code, where the user is prompted to enter the path to the CSV file and other parameters. """
